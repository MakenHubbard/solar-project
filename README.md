# Solar System Project

## Deployment 
  If you want to view the code for this project just click [here](https://github.com/MakenHubbard/MakenHubbard.github.io)
## Description
  In this project, we had to display the planets to the page in cards. Then we needed to have the name of planet displayed at first and when the mouse would hover over the card the planets name would disappear and display an image of the planet. When the user clicks on the planet a separate card will display with the information of that planet. When the user types a planets name into the search then it will display that specific card.
